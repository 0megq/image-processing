Pythons scripts for analzying images of test tubes.
I used `main2.py` mainly for learning OpenCV. `main.py` is the better one.

# Running

1. Optional: Creating a Virtual Environment

   I recommend creating a venv first by running:

   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

   Then find the activate script inside the new virtual enivornment. Run it and now you can run the following

2. Installing requirements
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Add images and change the filenames of the python scripts to load those images (images not included for privacy reasons)
4. Run either `main.py` or `main2.py` using `py fileName.py`.
